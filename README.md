# Terminal Parrot

I had to rename the package from `party-parrot` to `terminal-parrot` beacuse of the new npm name ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

npm module to party hard in your terminal!

# Try it!
```js
npx terminal-parrot
```

or

```js
npm i -g terminal-parrot
terminal-parrot
```
# Prerequisites
The module is using `async/await` so node >= 7.6 is needed
